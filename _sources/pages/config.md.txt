# Configuration

Since fish diffusion supports various modules, writing a good config file is essential. There are many examples in the configs folder.  
To begin with, you should create a config file `exp_xxxxxx.py` in the `configs` folder with the following code:

```python
_base_ = [
    "./_base_/archs/diff_svc_v2.py",  # Using Diff SVC v2 architecture
    "./_base_/trainers/base.py",  # Use default trainer (with DDP + fp16)
    "./_base_/schedulers/warmup_cosine.py",  # Use Cosine Learning Rate Scheulder
    "./_base_/datasets/audio_folder.py",  # Use the default dataset and dataloader
]

```

## Preprocessing
Preprocessing config currently includes two components: `text_features_extractor` and `pitch_extractor.` 

Stable feature extractors are `HubertSoft`, `ChineseHubertSoft`, and `ContentVec`. Although there is a `Chinese` in the second one, it works on multilingual and outperforms the vanilla one.

To extract the pitch, you can choose `ParselMouthPitchExtractor` or `CrepePitchExtractor`. ParselMouth is good enough in most cases, and it's literally 100x faster than Crepe. However, in some edge cases, Crepe is more robust and stable. For more results, see [Pitch Extractors](https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-diffusion/wiki/Pitch-Extractors).

```python
# HubertSoft Example
preprocessing = dict(
    text_features_extractor=dict(
        type="HubertSoft",
    ),
    pitch_extractor=dict(
        type="ParselMouthPitchExtractor",
    ),
)

# ChineseHubertSoft Example
text_features_extractor=dict(
    type="ChineseHubertSoft",
    pretrained=True,  # Use Lengyue's Chinese Hubert Soft Model
    gate_size=25,  # Controlling how much information can be kept. Too large will lead to information leaking.
),
```

> Note: You need to rerun the preprocessing command after you change the preprocessing config.

## Dataset
Be default, `./_base_/datasets/naive_svc.py` will try to load data from `dataset/train` and `dataset/valid`. However, if you want to train a multi speakers model, you should refer to `svc_hubert_soft_multi_speakers.py`. For example:

```python
dataset = dict(
    train=dict(
        _delete_=True,  # Delete the default train dataset
        type="ConcatDataset",  # You want to contact multiple datasets
        datasets=[
            dict(
                type="NaiveSVCDataset",
                path="dataset/speaker_0",  # First speaker's data folder
                speaker_id=0,  # Dataset for the first speaker
            ),
            dict(
                type="NaiveSVCDataset",
                path="dataset/speaker_1",
                speaker_id=1,
            ),
        ],
        # Are there any other ways to do this?
        collate_fn=NaiveSVCDataset.collate_fn,
    ),
    valid=dict(
        type="NaiveSVCDataset",  # Only use one speaker to validate
        path="dataset/valid",
        speaker_id=0,
    ),
)

model = dict(
    speaker_encoder=dict(
        input_size=2,  # 2 speakers
    ),
)

```

Since this is a Python script, you can load dataset from any folder you like.  
But... What if I have 100+ speakers? I can't setup manually and I don't know how to write Python code :(  
Don't worry. You can use the following folder structure and scripts:
```
dataset
├───train
│   ├───speaker0 # Train data for speaker 0
│   |   └───xxx1-xxx1.wav
│   └───speaker1
│       └───xxx1-xxx1.wav
└───valid
    ├───speaker0  # Test data for speaker 0. You can pick some from other speakers
    |   └───xxx1-xxx1.wav
    └───speaker1
        └───xxx1-xxx1.wav
```

```python
from fish_diffusion.datasets.utils import get_speaker_map_from_subfolder, get_datasets_from_subfolder

speaker_mapping = {}

speaker_mapping = get_speaker_map_from_subfolder("dataset/train", speaker_mapping) # Update speaker_mapping using subfolders in `dataset/train`.

# This will update speaker_mapping to {'speaker0': 0, 'speaker': 1}

train_datasets = get_datasets_from_subfolder("NaiveSVCDataset", "dataset/train", speaker_mapping)  # Build datasets manually.
valid_datasets = get_datasets_from_subfolder("NaiveSVCDataset", "dataset/valid", speaker_mapping)  # Build datasets manually.

dataset = dict(
    train=dict(
        _delete_=True,  # Delete the default train dataset
        type="ConcatDataset",  # You want to contact multiple datasets
        datasets=train_datasets,
        # Are there any other ways to do this?
        collate_fn=NaiveSVCDataset.collate_fn,
    ),
    valid=dict(
        _delete_=True,  # Delete the default train dataset
        type="ConcatDataset",  # You want to contact multiple datasets
        datasets=valid_datasets,
        # Are there any other ways to do this?
        collate_fn=NaiveSVCDataset.collate_fn,
    ),
)

model = dict(
    speaker_encoder=dict(
        input_size=len(speaker_mapping),
    ),
)
```
## Data Augmentation
To enable data augmentation, you can reference to the following config:

```python
preprocessing = dict(
    ...
    augmentations=[
        dict(
            type="FixedPitchShifting",
            key_shifts=[-5., 5.],
            probability=0.75,
        ),
        dict(
            type="RandomPitchShifting",
            key_shifts=[-5., 5.],
            probability=1.5,
        ),
        dict(
            type="RandomTimeStretching",
            factors=[0.8, 1.2],
            probability=0.75,
        ),
    ]
)
```

After editing the config, you need to rerun the preprocessing command.

> Note: You should not use `RandomPitchShifting` and `RandomTimeStretching` at the same time.   
> RandomTimeStretching is not tested yet (as of 2023-03-03).

## Appendix: Pitch Extractors
Currently, this repo supports ParselMouth, Crepe, Harvest, and Dio. However, we recommend only using **Crepe** and **ParselMouth**. 
- If your dataset is small and you want it to be more robust, Crepe is probably good for you. 
- Otherwise, you should use ParselMouth since it is much faster.
