## Summary
Using Diffusion Model to solve different voice generating tasks. Compared with the original diffsvc repository, the advantages and disadvantages of this repository are as follows:
+ Support multi-speaker
+ The code structure of this repository is simpler and easier to understand, and all modules are decoupled
+ Support [44.1khz Diff Singer community vocoder](https://openvpi.github.io/vocoders/)
+ Support multi-machine multi-devices training, support half-precision training, save your training speed and memory

## Preparing the environment
The following commands need to be executed in the conda environment of python 3.10

```bash
# Install PyTorch related core dependencies, skip if installed
# Reference: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
conda install "pytorch>=2.0.0" "torchvision>=0.15.0" "torchaudio>=2.0.0" pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# Install Poetry dependency management tool, skip if installed
# Reference: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install the project dependencies
poetry install
```

## Vocoder preparation
Fish Diffusion requires the [FishAudio NSF-HiFiGAN](https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-diffusion/releases/tag/v2.0.0) vocoder to generate audio.

### Automatic download
```bash
python tools/download_nsf_hifigan.py
```

If you are using the script to download the model, you can use the `--agree-license` parameter to agree to the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.

```bash
python tools/download_nsf_hifigan.py --agree-license
```

### Manual download
Download and unzip `nsf_hifigan-stable-v1.zip` from [Fish Diffusion Release](https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-diffusion/releases/tag/v2.0.0)  
Copy the `nsf_hifigan` folder to the `checkpoints` directory (create if not exist)

If you want to download [ContentVec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec) manually, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-diffusion/releases/download/v1.12/content-vec-best-legacy-500.pt) and put it in the `checkpoints` directory.

## Dataset preparation
You only need to put the dataset into the `dataset` directory in the following file structure

```shell
dataset
â”œâ”€â”€â”€train
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€xxx1-xxx1.wav
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€Lxx-0xx8.wav
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€speaker0 (Subdirectory is also supported)
â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€xxx1-xxx1.wav
â””â”€â”€â”€valid
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€xx2-0xxx2.wav
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€...
    â””â”€â”€â”€xxx7-xxx007.wav
```

```bash
# Extract all data features, such as pitch, text features, mel features, etc.
python tools/preprocessing/extract_features.py --config configs/svc_hubert_soft.py --path dataset --clean
```

## Baseline training
> The project is under active development, please backup your config file  
> The project is under active development, please backup your config file  
> The project is under active development, please backup your config file  

```bash
# Single machine single card / multi-card training
python tools/diffusion/train.py --config configs/svc_hubert_soft.py
# Multi-node training
python tools/diffusion/train.py --config configs/svc_content_vec_multi_node.py
# Environment variables need to be defined on each node,please see https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.5/clouds/cluster.html  for more infomation.

# Resume training
python tools/diffusion/train.py --config configs/svc_hubert_soft.py --resume [checkpoint file]

# Fine-tune the pre-trained model
# Note: You should adjust the learning rate scheduler in the config file to warmup_cosine_finetune
python tools/diffusion/train.py --config configs/svc_cn_hubert_soft_finetune.py --pretrained [checkpoint file]
```

## Inference
```bash
# Inference using shell, you can use --help to view more parameters
python tools/diffusion/inference.py --config [config] \
    --checkpoint [checkpoint file] \
    --input [input audio] \
    --output [output audio]


# Gradio Web Inference, other parameters will be used as gradio default parameters
python tools/diffusion/inference.py --config [config] \
    --checkpoint [checkpoint file] \
    --gradio
```

## Convert a DiffSVC model to Fish Diffusion
```bash
python tools/diffusion/diff_svc_converter.py --config configs/svc_hubert_soft_diff_svc.py \
    --input-path [DiffSVC ckpt] \
    --output-path [Fish Diffusion ckpt]
```
