    content: "## Summary

    Using Diffusion Model to solve different voice generating tasks. Compared with the original diffsvc repository, the advantages and disadvantages of this repository are as follows:

    + Support multi-speaker
    
    + The code structure of this repository is simpler and easier to understand, and all modules are decoupled

    + Support [44.1khz Diff Singer community vocoder](https://openvpi.github.io/vocoders/)

    + Support multi-machine multi-devices training, support half-precision training, save your training speed and memory
